      <h1>Html (Hypertext Markup Language)</h1>
      <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a computer language used for creating web pages. It has a rich and fascinating history that has evolved significantly since its creation in the early 1990s. In this article, we will explore the historical facts and evolution of HTML from its inception to the present day.
      </p>
      <h2>The Origins of HTML</h2> 
      <p>
      In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) while working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. He created a system for linking documents together, which he called "hypertext." Hypertext allowed for non-linear navigation through documents by using clickable links. Berners-Lee realized that hypertext could be used to create a global information-sharing system, which he called the World Wide Web.
      </p>
      <p>
      The first web page was published in August 1991, and it was written in HTML. HTML was designed as a markup language for creating documents that could be displayed on a web browser. It allowed authors to define the structure of a document using tags, which indicated the beginning and end of different sections of the document.
      </p>
      <h2>HTML 2.0 and the Birth of Web Standards</h2>
      <p>
      In 1995, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded to promote web standards and to develop and maintain web technologies. The first official version of HTML, HTML 2.0, was released in the same year. HTML 2.0 introduced many of the features that we still use in HTML today, including tables and forms.
      </p>
      
      <h2> HTML 3.2 and the Rise of Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
      <p>
      In 1997, the W3C released HTML 3.2, which introduced support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). CSS allowed authors to separate the presentation of a document from its content. This made it easier to create visually appealing web pages that were also easy to maintain.
      </p>
      <h2>HTML 4.01 and the Dot-com Boom</h2>
      <p>
      In 1999, HTML 4.01 was released, which introduced many new features, including support for frames and multimedia content such as audio and video. This version of HTML was released during the dot-com boom, a period of rapid growth in the technology industry that saw many new companies and websites being created.
      </p>
      <h2>XHTML and the Move to XML</h2>
      <p>
      In 2000, the W3C released XHTML 1.0, which was designed to be a stricter and more standardized version of HTML. XHTML was based on the Extensible Markup Language (XML), which was seen as the future of web development. However, XHTML was not widely adopted, and many developers continued to use HTML.
      </p>
      <h2>HTML5 and the Mobile Revolution</h2>
      <p>
      In 2014, HTML5 was released, which introduced many new features and improvements over previous versions of HTML. HTML5 was designed to be more mobile-friendly, and it introduced many new features such as the canvas element, which allowed for the creation of interactive graphics on web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
      HTML5 also introduced many new APIs, such as the Geolocation API, which allowed web applications to access the user's location information. This made it possible to create many new types of web applications, such as location-based services and mobile games.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
      HTML has come a long way since its creation in the early 1990s. It has evolved from a simple markup language for creating documents to a powerful tool for creating rich, interactive web applications. HTML has played a vital role in the growth of the World Wide Web, and it continues to be an essential technology for web developers today.
