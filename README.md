## 2.	REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS
- 1.1	Design a website that incorporates a main navigation menu and a structured layout

- 1.3	Design the organisation of information on the page following the principles of user experience design (headers are used to convey structure, information is easy to find due to being presented and categorised in terms of priority)
- 1.4	Ensure that foreground information is never distracted by backgrounds
- 1.5	Include graphics that are consistent in style and colour
- 1.6	Design the site to allow the user to initiate and control actions such as the playing of audio/video.

- 2.2	Write custom HTML code that passes through the official W3C validator with no issues.
- 2.3  Write custom CSS code that passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues
- 2.4  Incorporate images that are of sufficient resolution to not appear pixelated or stretched
- 2.5  Code all external links to open in a separate tab when clicked
- 2.6  Use CSS media queries across the application to ensure the layout changes appropriately and maintains the page's structural integrity across device screen sizes.
- 2.7  Use Semantic markup to structure HTML code
- 2.8  Present the finished website with clearly understandable site-specific content rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text
- 2.9  Implement clear navigation to allow users to intuitively find resources on the site.
