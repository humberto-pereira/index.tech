      <h1>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h1>
      <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that was first introduced in 1996, and has since then revolutionized the way websites are designed and developed. CSS allows web developers to separate the presentation of a website from its content, making it easier to change the appearance of a website without altering its underlying code. In this article, we will explore the historical facts and evolution of CSS over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
      CSS was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie, a researcher at CERN, in October 1994. He presented the idea to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, who saw the potential for CSS to improve the web. The first version of CSS, called CSS1, was released in December 1996 as a recommendation from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the organization responsible for standardizing web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
      CSS1 was a significant improvement over its predecessor, HTML, which had limited control over the layout and presentation of web pages. CSS1 allowed developers to specify colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements using a separate stylesheet, rather than embedding these styles directly into the HTML code.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 1998, CSS2 was released, which added new features such as positioning, background images, and borders. However, it took several years for web browsers to fully support CSS2, which meant that web developers had to use workarounds and hacks to achieve the desired visual effects.
      </p>
      <p>
      In 2001, the W3C released the first draft of CSS3, which added even more features such as rounded corners, gradients, and animations. However, it wasn't until 2005 that the first CSS3 module was finalized, and it has since been split into separate modules, each with its own level of support.
      </p>
      <p>
      CSS has evolved significantly over the years, with new features and modules being added regularly. In recent years, CSS has become more powerful than ever, with the ability to create complex layouts and animations that were once only possible with JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the most significant changes to CSS in recent years has been the introduction of CSS Grid and Flexbox, which allow developers to create responsive layouts that adjust to different screen sizes and devices. These new layout tools have made it much easier to create modern, mobile-friendly websites.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition to its evolution as a language, CSS has also had a significant impact on the design and development of websites. With CSS, web developers can create beautiful, engaging websites that are both functional and visually appealing. CSS has also paved the way for new design trends such as minimalism, flat design, and material design.
      </p>
      <p>
      In conclusion, CSS has come a long way since its inception in 1996. From its early days as a simple stylesheet language to its current status as a powerful tool for creating responsive, modern websites, CSS has played a vital role in the evolution of the web. As web technologies continue to evolve, we can expect CSS to continue to play a significant role in shaping the future of web design and development.
